# King County causal inference challenge

[**Challenge details**](https://casbs.stanford.edu/causal-inference-social-impact-lab-s-data-challenge)

## Our initial hypotheses

**Question 1: Fare Reinstatement**

We think that the reinstatement of fares will decrease ridership due to high elasticity of demand for transportation. Removing fares leads to an increased ability to pay and thus more ridership; re-adding those fares should theoretically have the reverse effect, decreasing the ability to pay and decreasing ridership.

**Question 2: Fare Subsidies**

We think that long-term enrollment in transit programs will increase the longer the duration of the fare subsidies, again given the elasticity of demand. Low-level and long-term subsidies should theoretically encourage longer-term use of public transportation.
