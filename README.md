# King County causal inference challenge

## Our initial hypotheses

**Question 1: Fare Reinstatement**

We think that the reinstatement of fares will decrease ridership due to
high elasticity of demand for transportation. Removing fares leads to an
increased ability to pay and thus more ridership; re-adding those fares
should theoretically have the reverse effect, decreasing the ability to
pay and decreasing ridership.

**Question 2: Fare Subsidies**

We think that long-term enrollment in transit programs will increase the
longer the duration of the fare subsidies, again given the elasticity of
demand. Low-level and long-term subsidies should theoretically encourage
longer-term use of public transportation.
